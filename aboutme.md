My name is Hannah Dixon. I began completing my PEDAM degree in January of 2025. 
This is my last semester before I graduate in December! 
Some fun facts about me:

- I graduated with a B.S in psychology and neuroscience, and I have a minor in communications!
- I love animals, and in my free time I like to volunteer at the animal shelter.
